    \label{abs}The United States (US) has a large population of people that consume seafood every year. The US matches the demand through wild seafood catch, aquaculture production, and imports from other countries (The largest seafood exporters to the US are China, Thailand, Canada, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Ecuador). In this work, I review the USâ€™ dependence on wild seafood catch for seafood production and identify key deterrents stopping responsible domestic aquaculture development. In a world with a rapidly growing population and the risk of climate change impacting the marine environment, the US must shift its means of seafood production to aquaculture to continue supplying its citizens with seafood long term.
